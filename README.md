# Journal Accordion

The Journal Accordion is a simple web application that allows users to create journal entries and view them in an accordion-style format. Each entry consists of a title and a note, and the entries can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on them. The application also provides character count limits for both the title and note fields, with visual feedback when the limits are exceeded.

## Features

- Create journal entries with a title and note.
- Character count limits for the title (100 characters) and note (250 characters).
- Visual feedback (red border and shake animation) when character limits are exceeded.
- Accordion-style display for the journal entries, allowing users to expand or collapse them.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Styling language for designing the appearance of the web page.
- JavaScript: Programming language

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter a title for your journal entry in the "Note Title" input field. The character count is displayed below the input field.

2. Enter a note for your journal entry in the "Short Note" textarea. The character count is displayed below the textarea.

3. The character count will change dynamically as you type in the title and note fields. If you exceed the character limit, the text will turn red and the input field or textarea will shake briefly.

4. Click the "Add Journal Entry" button to add the entry to the accordion.

5. The added entry will appear at the bottom of the accordion. Click on an entry to expand or collapse it.
